## Part 1 – Automatic Requirement Generation

### 1. Data structure

**Description:** the extent to which it fully handles arbitrary predicates individual relational and boolean conditions represented and, or, not represented

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Fully handles relational and boolean conditions and handles logical operators.

### 2. Equivalent condition identification.

**Description:** Recognises inverted conditions, recognises different ordering of operands.

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Appears to recognize inverted and reordered equivalent conditions.

### 3. Automatic MCDC Requirement Generation (i)

**Description:** Generates all combinations. Handles ORs, ANDs, NOTs. Fully handles all arbitrary conditions.

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Appears to handle all logical operators but evaluation has no examples of negation.

### 4. Automatic MCDC Requirement Generation (ii)

**Description:** Generation of restricted MCDC requirements. The extent to which this is implemented and correctly functions.

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Looks like a reasonable attempt.

### 5. Automatic MCDC Requirement Generation (iii)

**Description:** Generation of correlated MCDC requirements. The extent to which this is implemented and correctly functions.

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Looks like a reasonable attempt.

## Part 2 – Automatic Test Case Generation

### 6. Instrumentation

**Description:** The extent to which the scheme proposed supports monitoring of satisfied conditions for test input generation 

**Verdict:** No solution at all (no evidence of criterion being attempted).

**Comment:** Not attempted.

### 7. Test Input Generation

**Description:** The extent to which inputs are generated by the tool to satisfy the test requirements generated. 

**Verdict:** No solution at all (no evidence of criterion being attempted).

**Comment:** Not attempted.

### 8. JUnit file Generation

**Description:** The extent to which the tool produces a JUnit file automatically. 

**Verdict:** No solution at all (no evidence of criterion being attempted).

**Comment:** Not attempted.

### 9. Assertion Generation

**Description:** The level to which assertions are generated to check the inputs generated.

**Verdict:** No solution at all (no evidence of criterion being attempted).

**Comment:** Not attempted.

### 10. The README.md file

**Description:** The extent to which it was easy to follow the student’s submission, install it, clearly documented etc.

**Verdict:** Partial solution - good attempt.

**Comment:** Brief but reasonable README file.

### 11. Video

**Description:** The extent to which the video assisted in assessing the other criteria based on the information given. 

**Verdict:** Full solution.

**Comment:** Good video.

### 12. Evaluation subjects

**Description:** Number and quality. Do they fully show off the strengths and weaknesses of the student’s solution (i.e., involve different, varied types of predicate), or are they limited.

**Verdict:** Partial solution - significant shortcomings.

**Comment:** Evaluation limited to just two *branches* (not full subjects). Subjects contain examples of AND and OR but no NOT.

## Summary

You appear to have understood the requirements of the data structure and how to generate MCDC requirements, but you've only completed part 1 of the assignment. Given that you've not attempted part 2, your evaluation is inevitably limited.

**Mark:** 53; after 1 day late = 50.4

Please note that marks are unconfirmed until the spring module board.
